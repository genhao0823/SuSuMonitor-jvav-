# SuSuMonitor WebSocket Protocol

**Version**: 1.1

**Time standard**: UTC ISO-8601, for example `2026-07-21T12:00:00Z`

**Deployment scope**: single JVM; connection and Monitor ticket state is in memory

## Channels

```text
/ws/agent   Agent authentication, heartbeat, metrics reporting and terminal responses
/ws/monitor Browser metrics subscription, metrics.update delivery and terminal requests
```

The legacy requirement aliases `/api/ws/agent` and `/api/ws/client` map to the current Spring WebSocket paths above. Long-lived JWT and Agent Token must not be placed in a URL. `/ws/monitor` accepts only a one-time 30-second Monitor ticket obtained from `POST /api/ws/monitor-ticket`.

## Common Message

```json
{
  "type": "heartbeat",
  "message_id": "uuid",
  "timestamp": "2026-07-21T12:00:00Z",
  "payload": {}
}
```

## Agent Messages

The first Agent message must be `agent.authenticate`:

```json
{
  "type": "agent.authenticate",
  "message_id": "uuid",
  "timestamp": "2026-07-21T12:00:00Z",
  "payload": {"server_id": 1, "token": "one-time-agent-token"}
}
```

Successful authentication returns `agent.authenticated` with payload `{"server_id": <id>, "authenticated_at": "<UTC ISO-8601>"}`. Authentication expires after 10 seconds if no valid first frame is received. A valid heartbeat updates `servers.last_heartbeat_at` and `agent_status=online`. The `heartbeat.ack` response payload is `{"server_id": <id>, "last_heartbeat_at": "<UTC ISO-8601>"}`. No heartbeat for 90 seconds marks the Agent offline. A newly authenticated connection replaces the previous connection for the same server.

The Agent message limit is 64 KiB. Invalid JSON uses close code `1007`; oversized messages use `1009`; policy/authentication failures use `1008`. The `error` message payload is `{"code": <int>, "message": "<string>"}`, where `code` uses the same numeric business error codes as the REST API (e.g. `40100` unauthorized, `40002` invalid request parameter). A connection or unauthenticated-session limit returns `42901` and closes with `1008`; heartbeat or metrics rate exhaustion returns `42902` followed by `1008`. Agent upgrade requests are limited per resolved client IP and receive HTTP `429` with `Retry-After: 60` before a WebSocket is created.

`metrics.report` contains one fixed-width `metrics` row, including `server_id`, `collected_at`, `cpu_percent`, `memory_percent`, `memory_used`, `memory_total`, `disk_percent`, `disk_used`, `disk_total`, `net_rx`, `net_tx`, `temperature`, and `load_avg`. Its `message_id` is a required UUID idempotency key. Retrying one report must reuse its original `message_id`; a duplicate is silently accepted without inserting another row or publishing `metrics.update` or `alert.push`. For one server, accepted `collected_at` values must be strictly increasing. A report with a timestamp less than or equal to the most recently accepted sample is rejected with the standard `error` payload and code `40002`; it is not persisted and emits no event. `metrics.report` has no acknowledgement frame.

## Monitor Messages

After ticket-authenticated handshake, a browser sends:

```json
{
  "type": "metrics.subscribe",
  "message_id": "uuid",
  "timestamp": "2026-07-21T12:00:00Z",
  "payload": {"server_id": 1}
}
```

`metrics.unsubscribe` removes a subscription. Duplicate subscriptions are idempotent. Only admin or approved users may subscribe to an active server.

After a committed Metrics transaction, subscribers receive:

```json
{
  "type": "metrics.update",
  "message_id": "uuid",
  "timestamp": "2026-07-21T12:00:00Z",
  "payload": {
    "server_id": 1,
    "metrics": {"cpu_percent": 35.2, "collected_at": "2026-07-21T11:59:58Z"}
  }
}
```

The broadcast never contains Agent Token, Token hash, SSH credentials, database credentials, or private keys.

## Security and Lifecycle

- Monitor ticket lifetime is 30 seconds, expires exactly at `expires_at`, and each ticket is consumed once.
- Ticket state is single-JVM memory only; Redis and distributed session state are not implemented.
- Metrics broadcast runs after the database transaction commits.
- Disconnect removes all subscriptions.
- Tokens and complete raw messages must not be logged.
- Agent client IP defaults to the TCP peer address. `X-Forwarded-For` is used only when the TCP peer is within `AGENT_TRUSTED_PROXY_CIDRS`; the resolver strips trusted proxies from right to left and never trusts a direct client header.

## Error Messages

Both Agent and Monitor channels use the same `error` message shape:

```json
{
  "type": "error",
  "message_id": "uuid",
  "timestamp": "2026-07-22T00:00:00Z",
  "payload": {"code": 40002, "message": "invalid request parameter"}
}
```

The `code` field uses the same numeric business error codes as the REST API (`ErrorCode.java`). Clients should branch on `code` rather than parsing `message` text.

## Alert Messages

After an alert is triggered and the alert evaluation transaction commits, subscribers of the affected server receive `alert.push`:

```json
{
  "type": "alert.push",
  "message_id": "uuid",
  "timestamp": "2026-07-22T00:00:00Z",
  "payload": {
    "server_id": 1,
    "alert": {"id": 1, "rule_id": 2, "metric": "cpu", "current_value": 90.5, "threshold_value": 80.0, "level": "warning", "status": "unread", "triggered_at": "2026-07-22T00:00:00Z"}
  }
}
```

`alert.push` reuses the `/ws/monitor` channel and `MonitorSubscriptionRegistry`. Only sessions subscribed to the affected `server_id` receive the push. The broadcast never contains Agent Token, SSH credentials, or database credentials.

## Terminal Messages

Terminal messages use the common outer structure, require a UUID `message_id`, and use a UTC ISO-8601 `timestamp`. Java routes browser control frames to the matching authenticated Agent and routes Agent responses only to the browser connection that created the session.

All users whose latest database `review_status` is `approved` may request a root terminal regardless of role. This grants control equivalent to root access on the target family Linux host. Java must recheck the latest user state for every `terminal.open`, `terminal.input`, `terminal.resize`, and `terminal.close`; it must not rely only on the Monitor handshake snapshot.

Browser to `/ws/monitor`:

```text
terminal.open    payload: server_id, cols (1-300), rows (1-100)
terminal.input   payload: session_id, data (Base64, decoded 1-16 KiB)
terminal.resize  payload: session_id, cols (1-300), rows (1-100)
terminal.close   payload: session_id
```

Java to `/ws/agent` uses the same four types and additionally includes `server_id`; `terminal.open` also includes the Java-generated UUID `session_id`.

For every browser control frame, Java rechecks the user's current `approved` status and the session ownership in persistent metadata. It then resolves the `session_id` through the single-JVM relay registry and serializes writes to the target Agent connection. Browser-supplied `server_id` and `session_id` are never trusted for existing sessions; Java injects the persisted values before forwarding.

Java applies independent in-memory Token Buckets before forwarding browser control frames. `terminal.open` is scoped to the originating Monitor WebSocket because no server session exists yet. `terminal.input`, `terminal.resize`, and `terminal.close` are scoped to the originating Monitor WebSocket plus the validated `session_id`, so a busy terminal cannot consume another terminal's control-frame allowance. The default limits are: open 6/minute with burst 2, input 600/minute with burst 120, resize 60/minute with burst 20, and close 30/minute with burst 10. Limits are configured only through `TERMINAL_OPEN_*`, `TERMINAL_INPUT_*`, `TERMINAL_RESIZE_*`, and `TERMINAL_CLOSE_*` environment variables. Java releases all buckets when the Monitor WebSocket closes. An over-limit frame is not relayed and receives `error.payload.code=42904`.

Agent to `/ws/agent`:

```text
terminal.opened  payload: server_id, session_id, shell
terminal.output  payload: server_id, session_id, data (Base64, decoded 1-16 KiB)
terminal.closed  payload: server_id, session_id, reason (1-128 chars)
terminal.error   payload: server_id, optional session_id, code, message (1-256 chars)
```

The browser must never send `terminal.opened`, `terminal.output`, `terminal.closed`, or `terminal.error`. The Agent must never send `terminal.open`, `terminal.input`, `terminal.resize`, or `terminal.close`. Java generates `session_id`; the browser and Agent cannot choose it. Terminal input and output must not be persisted or logged.

Before forwarding an Agent terminal response, Java validates its protocol payload, verifies payload `server_id` matches the authenticated Agent connection, and verifies that `session_id` is bound to that same server. `terminal.opened` transitions metadata to `open`; `terminal.closed` persists closure and removes the in-memory relay binding after delivery.

When the originating Monitor connection disconnects, Java removes its relay bindings, sends a server-generated `terminal.close` to each reachable Agent, and marks the related metadata closed. When the current Agent connection disconnects, Java marks its routed sessions as `error`; a superseded Agent connection cannot close sessions owned by its replacement.

Terminal-specific error codes are `40003` invalid payload, `40302` access denied, `40403` session not found, `40903` session state conflict, `40904` Agent offline, `42903` session limit reached, and `42904` terminal message limit reached.

## Runtime Validation

The following paths were validated against the isolated MySQL database `susumonitor_agent_ws_validation_20260721` and an application instance on port 18081:

```text
Agent Token REST       19 checks passed
/ws/agent              14 checks passed
/ws/monitor            16 checks passed
Flyway V1-V9           all success=1
```

The Agent validation covered authentication, heartbeat, Metrics persistence, latest/history queries and old Token rejection after rotation. The Monitor validation covered approved-user Ticket issue, subscribe, post-commit `metrics.update`, unsubscribe and single-use Ticket rejection.

Automated boundary tests additionally verify that a successful transaction sends one `metrics.update`, a rolled-back transaction sends none, a Ticket is usable at 29.999 seconds but rejected at 30 seconds, and two concurrent Ticket consumers produce at most one success.

The first version does not provide cross-JVM connection state, Ticket sharing, subscription routing or broadcast fan-out. These require an external state and messaging layer before multi-instance deployment.
